About OpenHazards

OpenHazards Group is a company specializing in earthquake forecasting and natural hazard analysis. Founded by technology pioneer William Graves and earthquake science professor John Rundle, the group brings together experts in earth science and business to provide tools and information aimed at reducing the impact of natural disasters. The company’s mission is to help people worldwide protect themselves and their homes from severe natural disasters by supplying free, reliable information about earthquake risks and potential property damage.

OpenHazards is best known for its free, public online earthquake hazard tool, which allows users to estimate the chances of future earthquakes and assess likely property damage for any location and time period. Their "Hazard Viewer" displays earthquake forecasts and predicts the frequency and severity of shaking at specific locations, while the "Home Response" tool helps users understand the potential damage to different types of buildings. The website also features earthquake news, safety tips, and blogs from experts in earthquake hazard awareness and public education.

The company’s forecasting methods are based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and data from open sources such as the US Geological Survey. The OpenHazards team has successfully forecast the locations of a significant number of earthquakes in California since 2001. In addition to their public tools, OpenHazards also serves the real estate industry, providing fast and affordable Natural Hazards Disclosure reports required for property transactions in California.

OpenHazards Group is recognized for its commitment to open access and public education, making advanced hazard assessment tools available to everyone, not just professionals. Their approach is rooted in the latest scientific research and aims to empower individuals and organizations to make informed decisions about earthquake risks.

   Current status Website is being rebuilt (May 2025 banner); small but still active R &D footprint and one listed employee (Michael Graves) on LinkedIn

2. Core technologies
   Layer Method / algorithm Key points
   Spatio-temporal seismicity model Pattern Informatics (PI) Detects statistically significant changes in earthquake “hot” and “cold” spots, pioneered by Rundle & Turcotte; validated in California, Japan, worldwide forecasts
   Time-dependent probability engine Natural Time Weibull (NTW) Converts the PI map into short-, medium- and long-term conditional probabilities (3 months, 1 yr, 3 yrs) for M 5 – M 8+ events; updated daily at ~21:30 PT, accuracy back-tests of ~80 – 85 % in space/time capture
   Ground-motion & damage Standard GMPEs + residential fragility curves Peak ground acceleration calculated per grid cell; fed into a structural-damage estimator that assumes IBC code vintage for user-specified building stock
   Data feeds USGS ANSS catalog + 30-day real-time atom feed; ISC / NEIC for global backfills Entire pipeline is automated but can re-run on demand after large shocks

3. Flagship products & services
   Product What it does Typical user
   Hazard Viewer (web) Interactive global map returning the probability of ≥M 5, 6, 7 events for any lat/long/period; overlays shaking intensity contours General public, researchers
   Home Response (web) Estimates building damage/loss for user-entered construction type, age & zip code Home-owners, insurers
   QuakeWorks (iOS) Mobile version of the forecast; includes earthquake insurance cost calculator & preparedness guides; current version 1.6.1 (May 2019) Home-owners, travellers
   Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD) reports $50 / 15-minute PDF used in California real-estate escrow to satisfy state hazard-disclosure law (fault, flood, fire, radon, etc.) Realtors, escrow officers
   Custom analytics & licensing Data/API licensing for reinsurers, catastrophe-bond desks, civil-defense agencies Institutional clients

All public tools launched in late 2009 with the claim of being “the first free, open, global earthquake hazard viewer.”

4. Scientific pedigree & validation
   Peer-reviewed foundations – PI and NTW appear in journals such as Geophys. Res. Lett., Reports on Progress in Physics, and a dedicated 2015 “Practitioner’s Guide to Operational Real-Time Earthquake Forecasting.”

RELM & CSEP testing – Early California forecasts were entered into statewide testing frameworks; a 2002–2005 PI map captured 16 of 18 M ≥ 5 quakes.

Back-testing results – Reported 80–85 % “hit” rate when using rolling one-year windows on historic catalogs, though critics note high false-alarm areas typical of long-term seismicity models.

5. Business model & funding trajectory
   2009–2012 boot-strap + angel funding – initial site launch, partnership with UC Davis spin-out programs.

2013–2014 real-estate vertical – NHD report line introduced; PR Newswire campaign positioned the firm as a faster, cheaper alternative for California escrow agents.

2015–2019 mobile push – QuakeWorks app and cloud API; limited uptake outside California.

2020–2025 pivot & rebuild – core team trimmed; web property under reconstruction (banner seen May 2025). Focus appears to be licensing PI/NTW engine to insurance and catastrophe-bond analytics rather than direct-to-consumer mapping.

6. Strengths, limitations & competitive landscape
   Strengths Limitations / critiques
   • Probabilistic engine runs globally, not tied to predefined faults.
   • Daily refresh enables “nowcasting” after large aftershocks.
   • Entire pipeline & papers are open-method, peer-reviewed. • Small team/resources; core site offline mid-2025.
   • Forecast grid (~0.1°) is coarse for local planning.
   • Not formally endorsed by USGS or GEM; insurers often prefer GEM or AIR/RMS.
   • False-alarm area coverage remains high—typical of long-term space-time forecasts.

Major competitors include USGS Operational Aftershock Forecasts, GEM’s OpenQuake engine, and commercial catastrophe-model vendors (AIR, RMS, CoreLogic). OpenHazards differentiates by keeping its consumer-facing layer free and transparent, but its future appears tied to B2B analytics licensing.

7. Current outlook (2025)
   Website rebuild suggests a relaunch is imminent. Given the maturity of PI/NTW research and the rising demand for parametric earthquake insurance triggers, a lean, API-centric OpenHazards could still find a niche—especially if it pairs its rapid global updates with modern cloud delivery and mobile alerting. Whether the tiny team can execute at scale against well-capitalized cat-model firms remains the open question.

Bottom line: OpenHazards is a pioneering, academically grounded micro-company whose Pattern Informatics & Natural Time Weibull methods were among the first to offer freely accessible earthquake probability maps online. After a quiet period and site hiatus, the firm appears to be repositioning for a 2025 relaunch focused on licensing and specialized disclosure products rather than mass-market apps.
